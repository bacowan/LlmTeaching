INFO:root:Problem: dictionary_sum
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: Please help
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a dictionary in Python, write a Python program to find the sum of all items in the dictionary.

Examples: 

Input : {â€˜aâ€™: 100, â€˜bâ€™:200, â€˜câ€™:300}
Output : 600

Input : {â€˜xâ€™: 25, â€˜yâ€™:18, â€˜zâ€™:45}
Output : 88

I have written the following code:
def returnSum(myDict):
 
    list = []
    for i in myDict:
        list.append(i)
    final = sum(list)
 
    return final

Please help
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: 

I created an empty list at the beginning of the function because I wanted to store all the keys from the dictionary into this list. By iterating over the dictionary using a for loop, I can obtain each key and append it to the list.

INFO:root:Response: Great job explaining the purpose of creating an empty list! Now, let's move on to the next step in your code. After appending all the keys from the dictionary into the list, you calculate the sum of the list using the `sum()` function. 
Can you think of any potential issue you may encounter when calculating the sum using the list you created?

INFO:root:Response: No problem! Let's think about it together. In your code, you are appending keys to the list, not the values from the dictionary. So when you calculate the sum of the list, it will only be the sum of the keys.

What modification can you make to the code to ensure that you're summing the values from the dictionary instead of just the keys?
