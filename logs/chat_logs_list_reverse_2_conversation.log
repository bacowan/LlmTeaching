INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm getting an error
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Sure! Here's my question: What is the purpose of the 'temp' variable in your code?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I believe the purpose of the 'temp' variable is to temporarily store the value of the first element in the list, so that it can be swapped with the value of the last element.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: That's correct! The 'temp' variable acts as a temporary placeholder to store the value of the first element before swapping it with the last element. 

Now, my next question is: What do you think is causing the error in your code?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm not sure...
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: That's okay! Let's break down the error together. Take a look at the line where you swap the first and last elements of the list. Do you notice any potential issues with the code?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm really stuck and I can't seem to find any issues with the code. I have checked the line where the swapping happens, but everything seems fine to me.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: No problem! Let's examine the code further. One thing to consider is the 'size' variable that is used to access the last element of the list. Can you think of any issues that might arise regarding the 'size' variable?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: well, size should be the length of newList, so maybe there's something wrong with that
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Great observation! It seems that the variable 'size' is not defined anywhere in your code. Therefore, when you try to access the last element of the list using 'newList[size - 1]', it will result in an error. 

Now, I have another question for you: How can you fix this issue and correctly access the last element of the list?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: what if we set size to the length of newList at the start of the function?
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: That's a good approach! Setting the variable 'size' to the length of 'newList' at the beginning of the function would allow you to correctly access the last element using 'newList[size - 1]'. Additionally, since the length of the list can change, it's important to update the value of 'size' whenever needed.

Now, my question is: How would you modify your code to implement this solution?
