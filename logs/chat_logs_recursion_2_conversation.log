INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: This works, but isn't implemented with recursion.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Sure, I can help you with that. Let's start with a question: What is recursion and why do we use it in programming?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition is met. We use recursion when we want to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. By repeatedly solving these subproblems, we eventually arrive at the solution to the original problem. It's a way to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into simpler ones.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: That's a great explanation of recursion! Now, let's think about how we can apply recursion to solve the problem of finding the power of a number. Instead of using a loop to multiply the number repeatedly, how can we modify our approach to use recursion?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm really stuck on how to modify the approach to use recursion. I understand that recursion involves a function calling itself, but I'm not sure how to apply that concept to finding the power of a number. Can you provide some guidance on how to get started with the recursive approach?
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Of course! Let's break it down step by step. One way to approach this problem recursively is to think about the base case and the recursive case.

The base case is the simplest possible input where you don't need to make any further recursive calls. In this case, what would be a logical base case when finding the power of a number?

Once you identify the base case, you need to think about the recursive case. In other words, how can you break down the problem into a smaller, similar subproblem and use recursion to solve it?

Take a moment to think about these questions, and let me know if you have any ideas.
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm not entirely sure what the base case should be in this case. For the recursive case, I could try to think of it as breaking down the problem by reducing the power by 1 and repeatedly multiplying the number. However, I'm not sure how to tie this all together into a recursive function. I could use some more guidance on how to proceed.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Absolutely! Let's continue to analyze the problem. 

To find the base case, think about when we can directly compute the power without making any further recursive calls. In other words, what would be the simplest case where we don't need to repeatedly multiply the number?

For the recursive case, you're on the right track! We can break down the problem by reducing the power by 1 and repeatedly multiplying the number. Once we have the solution for the subproblem with a smaller power, how can we use it to solve the original problem?

Take a moment to think about these questions, and let me know if you have any ideas. We're close to understanding how to implement the recursive function!
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I believe the base case when finding the power of a number could be when the power (p) is equal to 0. In this case, the power would always be 1, regardless of the number (n). So, we could return 1 as the base case. As for the recursive case, we could call the function recursively with the same number (n) but reduce the power (p) by 1 in each recursive call. Then, we would multiply the number (n) with the result of the recursive call to gradually compute the power. But I'm still not entirely sure how to write the recursive function that ties it all together. Could you give me some guidance on that? Thanks for your help!
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: You're absolutely correct! The base case would be when the power (p) is equal to 0, as any number raised to the power of 0 is always 1.

To write the recursive function, you need to define how the function should behave in both the base case and the recursive case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. If the power (p) is 0, return 1 as the base case.
2. If the power (p) is not 0, call the function recursively and pass the same number (n) but with the power (p) reduced by 1.
3. Multiply the number (n) with the result of the recursive call.
4. Return the multiplied result.

Now it is time to assemble all these steps together into the recursive function implementation. Give it a try, and let me know how it goes!
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: Okay I implemented it, but I'm still not sure about the recursive call: I have: return pow(n, n-1)
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Great job on giving it a try! Now, let's analyze the line of code `return pow(n, n-1)` that you have implemented for the recursive call.

Based on your explanation, you are passing the same number (`n`) but reducing the power (`p`) by 1 in each recursive call. However, it seems that you have used `n` instead of `p` for the second argument of the recursive call.

Let's think about it: What should be the second argument of the recursive function when making the recursive call? How can we correctly pass the number (`n`) and reduce the power (`p`) by 1 in each recursive call?

Take a moment to reconsider these questions and make the necessary adjustment to your code. Feel free to share your revised implementation, and we can continue from there!
