INFO:root:Problem: tuple_cube
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm not getting the expected result
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list of numbers of list, write a Python program to create a list of tuples having first element as the number and second element as the cube of the number.

Example:

Input: list = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [(1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27)]

Input: list = [9, 5, 6]
Output: [(9, 729), (5, 125), (6, 216)]

I have written the following code:
list1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]
 
# using list comprehension to iterate each
# values in list and create a tuple as specified
res = [(val, val * 3) for val in list1]
 
# print the result
print(res)

I'm not getting the expected result
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Why did you choose to multiply each element by 3 in the list comprehension?

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Great! It's good that you're attempting to find the cube of the number. However, multiplying the element by 3 will only give the cube if the number itself is 3. 

Now, let's think about how we can calculate the cube of a number. What mathematical operation can we use to get the cube of a number?

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows:
We can modify the code to calculate the cube of each number by changing the expression in the list comprehension to `val ** 3` instead of `val * 3`. This will raise each element to the power of 3, giving us the cube.
