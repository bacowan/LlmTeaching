	\section{Introduction}
		Education is becoming more and more virtual, with students spending more and more time learning autonomously. When learning autonomously, it can be hard to get good constructive feedback. For example, professors are busy and may not have time to answer questions promptly, and some students are hesitant to ask questions. Furthermore, professors may find themselves answering the same questions from students over and over again. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT, students now have a way to get quick feedback. However, such feedback is not always useful; they can easily ask the LLM to simply fix their problem or solve an assignment for them, and not actually understand the output; sometimes an assignment is designed to teach a specific concept, which may not be conveyed in a response from an LLM.
