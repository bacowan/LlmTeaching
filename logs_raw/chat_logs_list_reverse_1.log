INFO:root:Problem: list_reverse
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm getting an error
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list, write a Python program to swap first and last element of the list.

Examples: 

Input : [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
Output : [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]

Input : [1, 2, 3]
Output : [3, 2, 1]

I have written the following code:
def swapList(newList):
    temp = newList[0]
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]
    newList[size - 1] = temp
     
    return newList

I'm getting an error
INFO:root:Response: The code you provided is almost correct. The error you mentioned is likely due to the fact that the variable `size` is not defined in your code. To fix this issue, you can use the `len()` function to get the length of the list and assign it to `size`. Here's the modified code:

```python
def swapList(newList):
    size = len(newList)
    temp = newList[0]
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]
    newList[size - 1] = temp
    return newList
```

This should resolve the error.

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows:

I think you're on the right track with your code! The issue you're encountering is with the variable `size` which is not defined in your code. To fix this, you can use the `len()` function to get the length of the `newList` and assign it to `size`. After making this modification, your code should work perfectly fine. Great job so far, just make that small adjustment!
