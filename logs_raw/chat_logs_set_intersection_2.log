INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: It isn't giving the correct result
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given two lists a, b. Check if two lists have at least one element common in them. 

Examples:

Input : a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : True

Input : a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b=[6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : False

I have written the following code:

def common_data(list1, list2):
    result = False
 
    # traverse in the 1st list
    for x in list1:
 
        # traverse in the 2nd list
        for y in list2:
   
            # if one common
            if x == y:
                result = True
            else:
                result = False
                 
    return result

It isn't giving the correct result
INFO:root:Response: The issue with your code is that you are setting the result variable to False at the beginning of each iteration of the inner loop. This means that if the first element in list1 is not equal to the first element in list2, the result will be set to False even if subsequent elements are equal.

To fix this issue, you can modify your code to break out of the loop and return True as soon as you find a common element. Here's an updated version of your code:

def common_data(list1, list2):
    # traverse in the 1st list
    for x in list1:
        # traverse in the 2nd list
        for y in list2:
            # if one common, return True
            if x == y:
                return True
 
    # if no common element found, return False
    return False

This updated code will return True if a common element is found in the two lists, and False otherwise.

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's really stuck. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: 

I have been working on the code and I'm really stuck. I tried running the code, but it's not giving me the correct output. I'm a bit lost on what the issue might be. Here's the code I have so far:

```
def common_data(list1, list2):
    result = False

    # traverse in the 1st list
    for x in list1:
        # traverse in the 2nd list
        for y in list2:
            # if one common
            if x == y:
                result = True
            else:
                result = False

    return result
```

I would really appreciate it if you could take a look and help me figure out what's wrong.
