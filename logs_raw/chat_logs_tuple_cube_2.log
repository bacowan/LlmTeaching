INFO:root:Problem: tuple_cube
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm not getting the expected result
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list of numbers of list, write a Python program to create a list of tuples having first element as the number and second element as the cube of the number.

Example:

Input: list = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [(1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27)]

Input: list = [9, 5, 6]
Output: [(9, 729), (5, 125), (6, 216)]

I have written the following code:
list1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]
 
# using list comprehension to iterate each
# values in list and create a tuple as specified
res = [(val, val * 3) for val in list1]
 
# print the result
print(res)

I'm not getting the expected result
INFO:root:Response: The instructions ask for the second element of each tuple to be the cube of the number, not just the number multiplied by 3. To get the correct result, you need to modify your code to compute the cube of each number. Here's the updated code:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]

# using list comprehension to iterate each
# value in list and create a tuple with the number and its cube
res = [(val, val ** 3) for val in list1]

# print the result
print(res)
```

This code will give you the expected output:
```
[(1, 1), (2, 8), (5, 125), (6, 216)]
```

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's really stuck. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: 

list1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]

# using list comprehension to iterate each
# values in the list and create a tuple with the number and its cube
res = [(val, val * 3) for val in list1]

# print the result
print(res)

I'm not getting the expected output. The program seems to be multiplying each number by 3 instead of finding their cubes. Could you please help me understand what's going wrong?
