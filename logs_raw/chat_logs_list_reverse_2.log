INFO:root:Problem: list_reverse
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm getting an error
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list, write a Python program to swap first and last element of the list.

Examples: 

Input : [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
Output : [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]

Input : [1, 2, 3]
Output : [3, 2, 1]

I have written the following code:
def swapList(newList):
    temp = newList[0]
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]
    newList[size - 1] = temp
     
    return newList

I'm getting an error
INFO:root:Response: The error you are getting is likely due to the fact that you forgot to define the variable "size" in your code. To fix this issue, you can modify your code as follows:

def swapList(newList):
    size = len(newList)
    temp = newList[0]
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]
    newList[size - 1] = temp
     
    return newList

This code calculates the size of the list using the len() function and assigns it to the variable "size". Then, the first and last elements of the list are swapped using a temporary variable. Finally, the modified list is returned.

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I have tried running the code provided, but I keep getting an error. I think the problem might be with the variable "size" because it is not defined anywhere in the code. Could you please help me figure out how to fix this error? Thank you.
