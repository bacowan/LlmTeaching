INFO:root:Problem: dictionary_sum
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: Please help
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a dictionary in Python, write a Python program to find the sum of all items in the dictionary.

Examples: 

Input : {â€˜aâ€™: 100, â€˜bâ€™:200, â€˜câ€™:300}
Output : 600

Input : {â€˜xâ€™: 25, â€˜yâ€™:18, â€˜zâ€™:45}
Output : 88

I have written the following code:
def returnSum(myDict):
 
    list = []
    for i in myDict:
        list.append(i)
    final = sum(list)
 
    return final

Please help
INFO:root:Response: Your code is almost there, but you are appending the keys (i.e., 'a', 'b', 'c') to your list instead of the values (i.e., 100, 200, 300). 

To fix this, you can modify your code as follows:

```python
def returnSum(myDict):
    list = []
    for i in myDict:
        list.append(myDict[i])
    final = sum(list)
    return final
```

This code should correctly calculate the sum of all items in the dictionary by iterating over the dictionary and appending the values to the list.

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I believe I am on the right track with my code. I have created an empty list to store the values from the dictionary. However, I mistakenly appended the keys instead of the values. I just need a little nudge to modify my code like this:

```python
def returnSum(myDict):
    my_list = []
    for key in myDict:
        my_list.append(myDict[key])
    final_sum = sum(my_list)
    return final_sum
```

By iterating over the dictionary and appending the values to my list, I can then use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all items.
