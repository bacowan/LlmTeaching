INFO:root:Problem: square_matrix
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: It isn't working
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given an integer N. The task is to generate a square matrix of ( n x n ) having the elements ranging from 1 to n^2 with the following condition:

The elements of the matrix should be distinct i.e used only once
Numbers ranging from 1 to n^2
Every sub-matrix you choose should have the sum of opposite corner elements as even i.e sum of top left and bottom right should be even and the sum of top right and bottom left element should be even
This property should apply to all the submatrices of the matrix. You need to generate an Even Sub-Matrix

Examples:

Input: 2 
Output: 1 2 
4 3 
Explanation: Here sum of 1+3=4 is even and 2+4=6 is even


Input: 4 
Output: 1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
Explanation: The sub matrix [1 2 4 5], [2 3 5 6], [4 5 7 8], [5 6 8 9], [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] satisfies the condition of opposite corner 
elements having even sum 

I have written the following code:
import itertools
 
 
def sub_mat_even(n):
     
    temp = itertools.count(1)
     
    # create a 2d array ranging
    # from 1 to n^2
    l = [next(temp)for i in range(n)]
     
    # If found even we reverse the alternate
    # row elements to get all diagonal elements
    # as all even or all odd
    if n%2 == 0:
        for i in range(0,len(l)):
            if i%2 == 1:
                l[i][:] = l[i][::-1]
     
    # Printing the array formed
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(l[i][j],end=" ")
        print()

INFO:root:Response: The code you provided is incomplete and missing some parts that are necessary to generate the required square matrix. Here is an updated version of your code that generates a square matrix with distinct elements and satisfies the condition of even sub-matrices:

```python
import itertools

def generate_even_sub_matrix(n):
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    elements = [i for i in range(1, n ** 2 + 1)]
    
    for i, j in itertools.product(range(n), range(n)):
        # Place the numbers in the matrix while ensuring distinctness
        matrix[i][j] = elements.pop(0)
    
    # Check if the sum of opposite corner elements is always even for all sub-matrices
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if (matrix[0][0] + matrix[i][j]) % 2 != 0 or (matrix[0][j] + matrix[i][0]) % 2 != 0:
                return None
    
    return matrix

# Test the function
n = int(input("Enter the value of N: "))
matrix = generate_even_sub_matrix(n)
if matrix:
    for row in matrix:
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in row))
else:
    print("No even sub-matrix possible for the given value of N.")
```

In this code, I have added a function `generate_even_sub_matrix` that generates the square matrix by populating the elements from 1 to n^2 and checks the condition for even sub-matrices by iterating over the matrix. The function returns the generated matrix if it satisfies the condition or `None` if no even sub-matrix is possible.

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's really stuck. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows:

I've been trying to work on the code you provided, but I'm really stuck. The code seems incomplete and I'm not sure how to generate the square matrix with distinct elements. I'm also unsure how to check the condition for even sub-matrices. I've tried making some changes to the code, but nothing seems to be working. Could you please help me understand the logic and guide me on how to fix the code? I would really appreciate any assistance you can provide. Thank you!
