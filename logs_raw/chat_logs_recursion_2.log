INFO:root:Problem: recursion
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: This works, but isn't implemented with recursion.
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a number N and power P, the task is to find the power of a number ( i.e. NP ) using recursion.

Examples: 

Input: N = 2 , P = 3
Output: 8

Input: N = 5 , P = 2
Output: 25

I have written the following code:
def pow(n, p):
    ret = 1
    for _ in range(p):
        ret = ret * n
    return ret

This works, but isn't implemented with recursion.
INFO:root:Response: To implement the power function using recursion, you can modify your code as follows:

def pow(n, p):
    if p == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * pow(n, p-1)

This recursive function calculates the power of a number by multiplying the number (n) with itself (p-1) times. When the power (p) becomes 0, the function returns 1, which is the base case of the recursion.

You can test this code with the given examples to verify its correctness.

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's really stuck. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows:

I have tried implementing the power function using recursion, but I'm really stuck. Here is my code:

def pow(n, p):
    # I'm not sure how to proceed from here... help!
    pass

I understand that I need to find the power of a number (n) raised to (p), but I'm not sure how to do that recursively. I would greatly appreciate it if you could guide me through the correct implementation using recursion. Thank you!
