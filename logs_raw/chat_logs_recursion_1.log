INFO:root:Problem: recursion
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: This works, but isn't implemented with recursion.
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a number N and power P, the task is to find the power of a number ( i.e. NP ) using recursion.

Examples: 

Input: N = 2 , P = 3
Output: 8

Input: N = 5 , P = 2
Output: 25

I have written the following code:
def pow(n, p):
    ret = 1
    for _ in range(p):
        ret = ret * n
    return ret

This works, but isn't implemented with recursion.
INFO:root:Response: To implement the power calculation using recursion, you can modify the code as follows:

def pow(n, p):
    if p == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * pow(n, p-1)

In this recursive solution, the base case is when p becomes 0, at which point 1 is returned. Otherwise, the function multiplies n by the result of the function itself with p decremented by 1. This continues until the base case is reached.

Now, the pow() function calculates the power of a number using recursion.

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows:

I have made some progress in implementing the power calculation using recursion. Here is what I have so far:

```python
def pow(n, p):
    if p == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * pow(n, p-1)
```

I think this code is on the right track, as it uses a recursive approach to calculate the power of a number. However, I'm still working on fully understanding how the recursion is working. Can you provide any guidance or suggestions to help me improve my code?
