INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: It isn't giving the correct result
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given two lists a, b. Check if two lists have at least one element common in them. 

Examples:

Input : a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : True

Input : a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b=[6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : False

I have written the following code:

def common_data(list1, list2):
    result = False
 
    # traverse in the 1st list
    for x in list1:
 
        # traverse in the 2nd list
        for y in list2:
   
            # if one common
            if x == y:
                result = True
            else:
                result = False
                 
    return result

It isn't giving the correct result
INFO:root:Response: The issue with your code is that you are setting `result` to `False` in each iteration of the nested loops. This means that if there is at least one element in `list1` that is not present in `list2`, the final value of `result` will be `False`. You should only set `result` to `False` if you have exhausted all elements in both lists and no common element has been found.

Here's an updated version of your code that should work correctly:

```python
def common_data(list1, list2):
    result = False
 
    # traverse in the 1st list
    for x in list1:
 
        # traverse in the 2nd list
        for y in list2:
   
            # if one common
            if x == y:
                return True
                
    return False
```

In this version, as soon as a common element is found, we can immediately return `True`. If the nested loops complete without finding any common elements, we can then return `False`.

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I have written a code to check if two lists have at least one element common in them. However, it seems like there is an issue in my code where the result is not always correct. I have noticed that I am setting the result to False in each iteration of the nested loops, which might be causing the problem. I will try modifying my code to set the result to False only if I have exhausted all elements in both lists and no common element has been found. I will give it another shot and see if it gives the correct result.
