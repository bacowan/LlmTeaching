INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Why did you create an empty list at the beginning of the function? Can you explain the purpose of this list in your code?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I created an empty list at the beginning of the function because I wanted to store all the keys from the dictionary into this list. By iterating over the dictionary using a for loop, I can obtain each key and append it to the list.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Great job explaining the purpose of creating an empty list! Now, let's move on to the next step in your code. After appending all the keys from the dictionary into the list, you calculate the sum of the list using the `sum()` function. 
Can you think of any potential issue you may encounter when calculating the sum using the list you created?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: Not quite sure
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: No problem! Let's think about it together. In your code, you are appending keys to the list, not the values from the dictionary. So when you calculate the sum of the list, it will only be the sum of the keys.

What modification can you make to the code to ensure that you're summing the values from the dictionary instead of just the keys?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm iterating over the keys, so can I iterate over the values instead?
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Absolutely! Instead of iterating over the keys of the dictionary, you can modify your code to iterate over the values of the dictionary. This way, you will be able to append the values to the empty list and calculate the sum of the values correctly.

Can you come up with a modification to your existing code that will allow you to iterate over the values of the dictionary and calculate the sum of the values?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: what if I used the .values() function?
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: That's a great idea! By using the `.values()` function, you can directly iterate over the values of the dictionary without having to access them through their keys. This will allow you to append the values to the empty list and calculate the correct sum.

Can you modify your code to use the `.values()` function and calculate the sum of the values?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm not sure where to use that function though
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: No worries! Let's break it down. You mentioned using the `.values()` function. To utilize this function, you need to call it on your dictionary object. In which part of your code should you use this `.values()` function to obtain the values from your dictionary?

INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Why did you create an empty list at the beginning of your code?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I created an empty list at the beginning of my code because I thought it would be useful to store the keys of the dictionary in a list.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Great! Storing the keys of the dictionary in a list can be helpful for some operations. However, in this case, we don't actually need the list of keys. We just need to find the sum of all the values in the dictionary. So, is there any other way you can directly access the values in the dictionary without using a list?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: It was suggested to me that I use a list though
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: I apologize for any confusion caused. While using a list is one way to solve this problem, there is actually a more direct approach to find the sum of values in a dictionary without creating a list. Can you think of any other approach that would directly access the values of the dictionary?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm not sure how to directly access the values of the dictionary without using a list. I thought creating a list would be a good way to iterate over the dictionary and add up all the values.
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: No problem! I understand your reasoning. However, there is a more direct way to access the values of a dictionary without using a list. Can you think of any specific method or function that would allow you to directly extract the values from a dictionary?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I am not sure how to directly extract the values from a dictionary without using a list. I have only been thinking of iterating over the dictionary and appending the values to a list. Can you please guide me in the right direction?
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: Of course! In Python, there is a specific method that allows you to directly access the values of a dictionary. It gives you a sequence of all the values in the dictionary without needing to create a list. Can you think of any method or function that might fulfill this requirement?
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I googled it and google said that I should use the values() function
INFO:root:VisibleResponse: That's right! The `values()` function is the one you're looking for. It allows you to retrieve a sequence of all the values in a dictionary. Now that you know this, how could you modify your code to directly access the values of the dictionary using the `values()` function instead of creating a list?
