INFO:root:Problem: list_reverse
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm getting an error
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list, write a Python program to swap first and last element of the list.

Examples: 

Input : [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
Output : [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]

Input : [1, 2, 3]
Output : [3, 2, 1]

I have written the following code:
def swapList(newList):
    temp = newList[0]
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]
    newList[size - 1] = temp
     
    return newList

I'm getting an error
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Sure! Here's my question: What is the purpose of the 'temp' variable in your code?

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I believe the purpose of the 'temp' variable is to temporarily store the value of the first element in the list, so that it can be swapped with the value of the last element.

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: That's correct! The 'temp' variable acts as a temporary placeholder to store the value of the first element before swapping it with the last element. 

Now, my next question is: What do you think is causing the error in your code?

"My answer to your question is as follows: I believe the error in my code might be due to the 'size' variable not being defined. Since I am using it to access the last element of the list, it must be the length of the list. I forgot to include this step. Could that be the reason for the error?"

INFO:root:Response: That's okay! Let's break down the error together. Take a look at the line where you swap the first and last elements of the list. Do you notice any potential issues with the code?

INFO:root:Response: No problem! Let's examine the code further. One thing to consider is the 'size' variable that is used to access the last element of the list. Can you think of any issues that might arise regarding the 'size' variable?

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Great observation! It seems that the variable 'size' is not defined anywhere in your code. Therefore, when you try to access the last element of the list using 'newList[size - 1]', it will result in an error. 

Now, I have another question for you: How can you fix this issue and correctly access the last element of the list?

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: One way to fix this issue and correctly access the last element of the list is by using the index -1 instead of the variable 'size'. So, instead of 'newList[size - 1]', I can use 'newList[-1]' to refer to the last element of the list.

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: That's a good approach! Setting the variable 'size' to the length of 'newList' at the beginning of the function would allow you to correctly access the last element using 'newList[size - 1]'. Additionally, since the length of the list can change, it's important to update the value of 'size' whenever needed.

Now, my question is: How would you modify your code to implement this solution?
