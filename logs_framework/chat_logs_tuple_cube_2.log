INFO:root:Problem: tuple_cube
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm not getting the expected result
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list of numbers of list, write a Python program to create a list of tuples having first element as the number and second element as the cube of the number.

Example:

Input: list = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [(1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27)]

Input: list = [9, 5, 6]
Output: [(9, 729), (5, 125), (6, 216)]

I have written the following code:
list1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]
 
# using list comprehension to iterate each
# values in list and create a tuple as specified
res = [(val, val * 3) for val in list1]
 
# print the result
print(res)

I'm not getting the expected result
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Why did you use the expression 'val * 3' to calculate the second element of each tuple?

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's really stuck. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I used the expression 'val * 3' because I misunderstood the instructions and thought that the task was to find the cube of each number. So, I calculated the cube by multiplying each number by itself three times.

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Understood. Let's try to clarify the task further. What do the instructions mean by "the cube of the number"?

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: "The cube of a number refers to multiplying the number by itself twice. For example, the cube of 2 would be 2 * 2 * 2, which equals 8." 

Now, let's review your code. Is there anything in the code that indicates you are finding the cube of each number correctly?

INFO:root:Response: You're on the right track! To calculate the cube of a number, we need to raise it to the power of 3. Can you think of an exponentiation operator or function in Python that can help us achieve this?

INFO:root:Response: No worries! In Python, we can use the exponentiation operator `**` to raise a number to a specific power. To raise a number to the power of 3, we would use `** 3`. 

Now, can you think of a way to modify your code to calculate the cube of each number using this information?

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Apologies for any confusion caused. The `**` syntax is indeed correct for exponentiation in Python. It represents raising a number to a specific power. In this case, `** 3` represents raising a number to the power of 3, which is what we need to calculate the cube.

I encourage you to give it a try and modify your code accordingly. Let me know if you have any further questions!
