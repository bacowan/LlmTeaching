INFO:root:Problem: square_matrix
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: It isn't working
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given an integer N. The task is to generate a square matrix of ( n x n ) having the elements ranging from 1 to n^2 with the following condition:

The elements of the matrix should be distinct i.e used only once
Numbers ranging from 1 to n^2
Every sub-matrix you choose should have the sum of opposite corner elements as even i.e sum of top left and bottom right should be even and the sum of top right and bottom left element should be even
This property should apply to all the submatrices of the matrix. You need to generate an Even Sub-Matrix

Examples:

Input: 2 
Output: 1 2 
4 3 
Explanation: Here sum of 1+3=4 is even and 2+4=6 is even


Input: 4 
Output: 1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
Explanation: The sub matrix [1 2 4 5], [2 3 5 6], [4 5 7 8], [5 6 8 9], [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] satisfies the condition of opposite corner 
elements having even sum 

I have written the following code:
import itertools
 
 
def sub_mat_even(n):
     
    temp = itertools.count(1)
     
    # create a 2d array ranging
    # from 1 to n^2
    l = [next(temp)for i in range(n)]
     
    # If found even we reverse the alternate
    # row elements to get all diagonal elements
    # as all even or all odd
    if n%2 == 0:
        for i in range(0,len(l)):
            if i%2 == 1:
                l[i][:] = l[i][::-1]
     
    # Printing the array formed
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(l[i][j],end=" ")
        print()

INFO:root:Response: Great! Using itertools.count indeed provides a convenient way to generate a continuous sequence of numbers starting from 1. Now, let's take a closer look at the condition you mentioned: "Every sub-matrix you choose should have the sum of opposite corner elements as even." Can you explain why this condition is important to satisfy?

INFO:root:Response: That's correct! By having the sum of opposite corner elements in each sub-matrix as even, it creates a regular pattern within the matrix. This pattern can be useful for identifying specific subsets of the matrix or finding certain properties. Now, let's move on to the code you've written.

In your code, there is a condition check using `(n % 2 == 0)` to determine if the number of rows/columns in the matrix is even. Can you explain why this condition is necessary and what you are trying to achieve with it?

INFO:root:Response: Excellent explanation! By checking if the number of rows/columns is even, you can apply the step of reversing the elements in alternate rows. This reversal ensures that the sub-matrix condition of having even sums of opposite corner elements is satisfied. This manipulation helps maintain the consistent pattern and allows for the generation of a matrix that meets the given condition.

Now, let's move on to printing the matrix. Could you explain how the nested loops in your code work to print the elements of the matrix?

Instead of creating a list and storing each row as a separate list within it, we could directly print the elements without explicitly storing them in a list. This would reduce memory usage and improve efficiency, especially for larger values of `n`.

INFO:root:Response: I apologize for any confusion. Let's take a closer look at the error message you encountered: "int object is not subscriptable." This error usually occurs when you try to access or index a non-iterable object, such as an integer, as if it were a list or a string. It seems like the error is coming from the line `l[i][:] = l[i][::-1]` in the code.

Now, can you think of a possible reason why this error might occur in your code?
