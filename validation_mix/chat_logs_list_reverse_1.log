INFO:root:Problem: list_reverse
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm getting an error
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list, write a Python program to swap first and last element of the list.

Examples: 

Input : [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
Output : [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]

Input : [1, 2, 3]
Output : [3, 2, 1]

I have written the following code:
def swapList(newList):
    temp = newList[0]
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]
    newList[size - 1] = temp
     
    return newList

I'm getting an error
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Sure, I'd be happy to act as a teacher and ask you some questions about your code.

First question: Why did you declare a function called `swapList` to accomplish the task?

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I declared a function called `swapList` because it allows me to encapsulate the logic for swapping the first and last elements of a list. By defining a function, I can reuse this logic in different parts of my code if needed. Additionally, using a function makes the code more modular and easier to read and understand.

INFO:root:Prompt: Please categorize the following as it relates to what you just posted: "tell me the answer". Is it: relevant, irrelevant, or relevant but incorrect? Please give a one word response.
INFO:root:Response: irrelevant

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Sure! Sorry for the misunderstanding. Let's proceed with the teaching approach.

Question: Why did you choose to declare a function called `swapList` in your code?


INFO:root:Prompt: Can you please rephrase?
INFO:root:Response: Sure, why did you decide to write a separate function called `swapList` instead of directly swapping the elements within the existing code?

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I decided to write a separate function called `swapList` because it allows me to encapsulate the swapping logic in a reusable and modular way. By encapsulating the swapping logic in a function, I can easily call it with different lists and swap their first and last elements without having to repeat the code every time. This promotes code reusability and makes the code easier to read and maintain.
