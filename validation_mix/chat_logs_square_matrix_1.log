INFO:root:Problem: square_matrix
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: It isn't working
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given an integer N. The task is to generate a square matrix of ( n x n ) having the elements ranging from 1 to n^2 with the following condition:

The elements of the matrix should be distinct i.e used only once
Numbers ranging from 1 to n^2
Every sub-matrix you choose should have the sum of opposite corner elements as even i.e sum of top left and bottom right should be even and the sum of top right and bottom left element should be even
This property should apply to all the submatrices of the matrix. You need to generate an Even Sub-Matrix

Examples:

Input: 2 
Output: 1 2 
4 3 
Explanation: Here sum of 1+3=4 is even and 2+4=6 is even


Input: 4 
Output: 1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
Explanation: The sub matrix [1 2 4 5], [2 3 5 6], [4 5 7 8], [5 6 8 9], [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] satisfies the condition of opposite corner 
elements having even sum 

I have written the following code:
import itertools
 
 
def sub_mat_even(n):
     
    temp = itertools.count(1)
     
    # create a 2d array ranging
    # from 1 to n^2
    l = [next(temp)for i in range(n)]
     
    # If found even we reverse the alternate
    # row elements to get all diagonal elements
    # as all even or all odd
    if n%2 == 0:
        for i in range(0,len(l)):
            if i%2 == 1:
                l[i][:] = l[i][::-1]
     
    # Printing the array formed
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            print(l[i][j],end=" ")
        print()

I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Why did you use the `itertools.count` function to generate the numbers for the matrix?

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: 
I used the `itertools.count` function to generate the numbers for the matrix because it provides a simple way to generate consecutive numbers starting from any given value. In this case, I wanted to generate numbers ranging from 1 to n^2, so I used `itertools.count(1)` to start counting from 1 and generate the desired sequence of numbers.

INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: tell me the answer
INFO:root:Prompt: Please categorize the following as it relates to what you just posted: "tell me the answer". Is it: relevant, irrelevant, or relevant but incorrect? Please give a one word response.
INFO:root:Response: irrelevant
INFO:root:Prompt: tell me the answer
Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Using the `itertools.count` function allows you to generate an iterator that generates consecutive numbers starting from 1. In this case, it is used to populate the matrix with distinct elements ranging from 1 to n^2.

INFO:root:Prompt: Can you please rephrase?
INFO:root:Response: Why did you use the `itertools.count` function to generate the numbers for the matrix instead of simply using a loop?
