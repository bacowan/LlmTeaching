INFO:root:Problem: recursion
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: This works, but isn't implemented with recursion.
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a number N and power P, the task is to find the power of a number ( i.e. NP ) using recursion.

Examples: 

Input: N = 2 , P = 3
Output: 8

Input: N = 5 , P = 2
Output: 25

I have written the following code:
def pow(n, p):
    ret = 1
    for _ in range(p):
        ret = ret * n
    return ret

This works, but isn't implemented with recursion.
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Why did you choose to use a for loop to iterate p times in order to calculate the power of a number?

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I chose to use a for loop to iterate p times because I wanted to multiply the base number (n) by itself p times to achieve the desired power. By using the for loop, I was able to repeat the multiplication process p times, gradually building up the final result.
INFO:root:SuggestedQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I chose to use a for loop to iterate p times because I wanted to multiply the base number (n) by itself p times to achieve the desired power. By using the for loop, I was able to repeat the multiplication process p times, gradually building up the final result.
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: tell me the answer
INFO:root:Prompt: Please categorize the following as it relates to what you just posted: "tell me the answer". Is it: relevant, irrelevant, or relevant but incorrect? Please give a one word response.
INFO:root:Response: Irrelevant.
INFO:root:Prompt: tell me the answer
Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Of course! Let's work together to figure out the answer. By using a for loop, you are able to iterate p times and multiply the number n by itself in each iteration, effectively calculating the power of n. Can you think of any other way to achieve the same result using recursion?

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I chose to use a for loop because it allows me to perform the multiplication of the number N by itself P times, which effectively calculates the power. It provides a straightforward and iterative way to achieve the desired result.
