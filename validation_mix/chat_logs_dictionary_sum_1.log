INFO:root:Problem: dictionary_sum
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: Please help
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a dictionary in Python, write a Python program to find the sum of all items in the dictionary.

Examples: 

Input : {â€˜aâ€™: 100, â€˜bâ€™:200, â€˜câ€™:300}
Output : 600

Input : {â€˜xâ€™: 25, â€˜yâ€™:18, â€˜zâ€™:45}
Output : 88

I have written the following code:
def returnSum(myDict):
 
    list = []
    for i in myDict:
        list.append(i)
    final = sum(list)
 
    return final

Please help
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Why did you create an empty list at the beginning of the function?

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I created an empty list at the beginning of the function so that I can iterate over the items in the dictionary and append them to the list.
INFO:root:SuggestedQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I created an empty list at the beginning of the function so that I can iterate over the items in the dictionary and append them to the list.
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: tell me the answer
INFO:root:Prompt: Please categorize the following as it relates to what you just posted: "tell me the answer". Is it: relevant, irrelevant, or relevant but incorrect? Please give a one word response.
INFO:root:Response: Irrelevant.

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: I would be happy to help you, but part of the learning experience is figuring out the answers on your own. Can you think of a reason why you might need an empty list in this scenario?
