INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: It isn't giving the correct result
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given two lists a, b. Check if two lists have at least one element common in them. 

Examples:

Input : a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : True

Input : a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b=[6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : False

I have written the following code:

def common_data(list1, list2):
    result = False
 
    # traverse in the 1st list
    for x in list1:
 
        # traverse in the 2nd list
        for y in list2:
   
            # if one common
            if x == y:
                result = True
            else:
                result = False
                 
    return result

It isn't giving the correct result
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Why did you choose to use nested for loops in your implementation?

INFO:root:GetQuestion: Give me a sample response, but pretend you're a student who's on the right track, but need a little nudge. Do so by completing the statement: "My answer to your question is as follows:"
INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I chose to use nested for loops because I wanted to compare each element in the first list with every element in the second list. By doing this, I can check if any element in the first list is equal to any element in the second list and set the result accordingly.

INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: tell me the answer
INFO:root:Prompt: Please categorize the following as it relates to what you just posted: "tell me the answer". Is it: relevant, irrelevant, or relevant but incorrect? Please give a one word response.
INFO:root:Response: Irrelevant.
INFO:root:Prompt: tell me the answer
Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Nested for loops allow you to compare each element in list1 with each element in list2. This way, you can check for any common elements between the two lists. However, think about what might happen when you encounter a common element.

INFO:root:ResponseQuestion: My answer to your question is as follows: I decided to use two nested for loops because I wanted to compare every element in the first list (list1) with every element in the second list (list2). By using nested loops, I am able to iterate through each element in both lists and check for any common elements.
