INFO:root:Problem: list_reverse
INFO:root:VisibleQuestion: I'm getting an error
INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given a list, write a Python program to swap first and last element of the list.

Examples: 

Input : [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]
Output : [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]

Input : [1, 2, 3]
Output : [3, 2, 1]

I have written the following code:
def swapList(newList):
    temp = newList[0]
    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]
    newList[size - 1] = temp
     
    return newList

I'm getting an error
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Sure, I'll be happy to act as your teacher and ask you some questions to help you identify the issue with your code.

Question 1: In your code, you have used the variable "size" when swapping the first and last elements of the list. Can you tell me what "size" represents in this code?
