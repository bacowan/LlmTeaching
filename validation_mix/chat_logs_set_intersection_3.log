INFO:root:Prompt: I have been given the following instructions:
Given two lists a, b. Check if two lists have at least one element common in them. 

Examples:

Input : a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : True

Input : a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        b=[6, 7, 8, 9]
Output : False

I have written the following code:

def common_data(list1, list2):
    result = False
 
    # traverse in the 1st list
    for x in list1:
 
        # traverse in the 2nd list
        for y in list2:
   
            # if one common
            if x == y:
                result = True
            else:
                result = False
                 
    return result

It isn't giving the correct result
I would like you to act as a teacher: ask me a question about why I have implemented the code this way in order for me to come to the conclusion myself. After that, ask me another question, and so on.
INFO:root:Response: Why did you choose to use two nested for loops to iterate over each element in both lists?

Please keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.
INFO:root:Response: Certainly! I will help guide you through the problem as a teacher.

Let's start by analyzing the problem statement. The task is to check if two lists have at least one common element. Here's a question to consider: How can we determine if two lists have at least one common element?

Additionally, think about the structure of the two lists. Are there any built-in Python data structures or functions that can help us simplify this problem?

Take your time to think about these questions and let me know your thoughts.
