Given an integer N. The task is to generate a square matrix of ( n x n ) having the elements ranging from 1 to n^2 with the following condition:

The elements of the matrix should be distinct i.e used only once
Numbers ranging from 1 to n^2
Every sub-matrix you choose should have the sum of opposite corner elements as even i.e sum of top left and bottom right should be even and the sum of top right and bottom left element should be even
This property should apply to all the submatrices of the matrix. You need to generate an Even Sub-Matrix

Examples:

Input: 2 
Output: 1 2 
4 3 
Explanation: Here sum of 1+3=4 is even and 2+4=6 is even


Input: 4 
Output: 1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
Explanation: The sub matrix [1 2 4 5], [2 3 5 6], [4 5 7 8], [5 6 8 9], [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] satisfies the condition of opposite corner 
elements having even sum
